      <p>My name is Phillip Luther. I go by Phil.</p>
      <p>
        I'm a life-long<sup>*</sup> software engineer and classically trained musician. I'm also the
        creator of this blog and sole author creating its content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blog-relevant areas of current interest include the web audio API, using blockchain
        technology for non-crypt and non-NFT purposes, and YouTube guitar channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blog-irrelevant areas of current interest include sci-fi/fantasy across most mediums,
        micro-optimizing my living space, and battling to reconcile my love of strong drink with a
        desire to live a yogic lifestyle.

          I'm just over 40. Accounting for childhood and teenage buffoonery I'll translate "life
          long" to 25'ish years. Throwing that out for clarity.
